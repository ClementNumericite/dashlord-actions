## Dev

- A first step is to build a light index of latest scans in `www/src/report.json`. this is done by [`./src/index.js`](./src/index.js).
- The report website itself live in the `www` folder.

```sh
cd www
yarn
yarn start
```

ðŸ’¡ To work with fresh data, get the `report` artifact from some of your `Build website` dashlord job.
